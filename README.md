## Who am I?🤔

That's a big question, I'm currently working as a front end dev with a strong focus in React and Typescript, but have dabbled in many languages and learned programming first through C and C++.✨ I was introduced to programming through my education in the [Software Engineering Technology](https://www.conestogac.on.ca/fulltime/software-engineering-technology) program at Conestoga College.<br/><br/>
My foundation in C and C++ afforded me a deeper understanding of the application of high level functionality in low level terms, and as such I have an easy time picking up and applying new languages and their features. Looking past differences in syntax, concepts such as passing by reference, by value, as a reference, memory allocation, or stack and heap management are all well understood as to how they are managed by newer languages and frameworks. <br/><br/>
I have a general interest in the tech field and look forward to learning many new concepts on my journey through my software developer career. When I'm not at work, I'm either getting some game time in, at the gym, rock climbing, or cooking something tasty in the kitchen for myself and my partner.🧑‍🍳
